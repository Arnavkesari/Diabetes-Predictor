## Machine Learning Project for SOM 

### Diabetes Predictor

#### Overview
The Diabetes Predictor is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on various medical features. This project utilizes a dataset containing patient information and employs different machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model.

#### Features
1.Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset for optimal model performance.
2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and analyze the dataset to understand patterns and correlations.
3.Model Training: Train various machine learning models to predict diabetes.
4.Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
5.Prediction Interface: Provide an interface to input patient data and get predictions.
